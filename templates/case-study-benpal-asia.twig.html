        <h2 class="section__heading text-left">Issues / Challenges</h2>

        <p class="section__p">Historically, due to different departments / Business units along with Multiple Job levels, it was difficult for the client to administer the benefits. To further add on, the scheme design got more complex due to the complicated enrolment and product logic basis a combination of parameters. The scheme design and benefit administration was different across asia due to the difference in the nature of operations and demography. This was becoming challenging for the HR in absence of an integrated portal.</p>
